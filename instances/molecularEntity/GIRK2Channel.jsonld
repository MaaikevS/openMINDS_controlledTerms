  "definition": "The GIRK2 channel belongs to a family of inwardly-rectifying potassium channels that are activated by pertusin toxin sensitive G-protein coupled receptors.",
  "description": "GIRK2 potassium channels are primarily activated by the complex of GTP-binding protein beta subunits and GTP-binding protein gamma subunits. Once opened the GIRK2 channel allows the movement of potassium out of the cell causing the resting membrane potential to become more negative.",
