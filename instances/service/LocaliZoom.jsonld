  "definition": "Web application for viewing of series of high-resolution 2D images that have been anchored to reference atlases.",
  "description": "LocaliZoom allows the viewing and exploring of high-resolution images with superimposed atlas overlays, and the extraction of coordinates of annotated points within those images for viewing in 3D brain atlas space. It is well suited for the extraction of a limited number of coordinates, e.g. representing an electrode track or labelling within a small region of interest.
