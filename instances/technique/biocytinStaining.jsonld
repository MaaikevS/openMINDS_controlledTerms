  "definition": "In 'biocytin staining' the chemical compound biocytin is used to highlight morphological details of nerve cells.",
  "description":  "Biocytin staining is a technique commonly used in combination with intracellular electrophysiology for post-hoc recovery of morphological details of the recorded neurons. For this, the chemical compound biocytin is included in the recording electrode in order to fill the recorded cell. It allows for the visualisation of the dendritic arborization and the regions targeted by the axons of the recorded neurons.",
